I'm a PhD Student at Technical University of Munich! I am supervised by Prof. Gerhard Rigoll. Before that, I received my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Technical University of Munich and my Bachelor's degree from BoÄŸaziÃ§i University in 2017 and 2014, respectively.

My research interests lie in computer vision, deep learning, and their applications. Specifically on tasks related to video understanding, gesture recognition and action localization.
